## Description


### Contributing Guidelines:
- The code should include comments
- There should be proper documentation (description, inputs, and outputs) contained in the README.md file.
- The file should be in the proper directory (e.g., Python/project_directory/name_of_the_file)
- The file names must be in snake case (i.e., ' ' replaced by '_')
- If you're using images in the README.md file then put them in the images folder inside your project directory.
